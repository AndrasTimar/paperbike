# Paperbike
This is the repository for the Paperbike project, a GPS based bike computer using the [Lilygo T5 e-paper display](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t5-v2-3-1). The GPS module used is a Ublox GPS6MV2. 
The board has an integrated li-ion charge controller, which allows using a li-po or li-ion battery for the device.

## Features
Displays battery percentage, speed, and total distance based on GPS data. Double pressing the button resets the total distance.

## Planned features
Persisting GPS log to flash memory, and introducing a download mode, where the device either connects to a predefined WIFI network, or goes into AP mode and enables the download and erasure of the logs - preferably in JSON format.
